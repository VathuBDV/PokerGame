# Video Poker Game

## Description

This CLI Poker game where the user starts off with a bankroll of 1000$.
At each round, the user is dealt 5 cards and he has the option to discard
and replace up to 4 of the 5 cards. Based on the hand that the user has,
the user will win a certain amount of money. The user has the option to
play until he is out of money or to quit after a certain amount of rounds.

This was my final project for my Programming II course during my Winter 
semester of the year 2020.
